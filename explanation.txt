My script decodes a secret message by first fetching the HTML content from a public Google Docs URL using the `requests` library. It then parses this HTML with `BeautifulSoup` to locate a table containing the message data, extracting each character along with its x and y coordinates from the table rows. Finally, the script reconstructs the message by assembling the characters onto a grid based on their coordinates and prints the result to the console.
